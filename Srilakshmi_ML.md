I have basic knowledge on **Deep Learning & OpenCV** and an intermediate knowledge on **Machine Learning & Python**. I have worked as **Data Analyst Intern** at **The Shaadi Times Pvt.Ltd** and i'm currently working on a deep learning and opencv based project. I'm still learning to ace these topics and would like to learn more by working on these concepts.

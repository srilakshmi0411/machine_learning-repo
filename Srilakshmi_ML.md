I have basic knowledge on **Deep Learning & OpenCV** and an intermediate knowledge on **Machine Learning & Python**. I have worked as **Data Analyst Intern** at **The Shaadi Times Pvt.Ltd** and i'm currently working on a deep learning and opencv based project. I'm still learning to ace these topics and would like to learn more by working on these concepts. 

> #### Tools which I'm aware of and have used in my projects are:

> - **Pandas, Numpy, SKlearn**
> - **Tensorflow Hub, Tensorflow, MobileNetV2 Architecture, Keras Sequential Model, Data Augmentation, Convolution Neural Networks**
> - **Transfer Learning**
> - **Random Forests**
> - **Support vector machines**
> - **KNeighbors Classifier**
> - **Evaluation metrics(Precision, F1 score, Recall, ROC curve, ROC-AUC Curve, Confusion matrix, Classification report, Correlation matrix, Early Stopping, Adam Optimizer)**
> - **OpenCV (Basics)**
> - **Google Colab**
> - **Jupyter Notebook**
